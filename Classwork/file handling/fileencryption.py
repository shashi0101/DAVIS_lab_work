# Caesar Cipher Encryption
#algoritm:-------
#Start
#Open source file in read mode
#Open new file in write mode
#Take shift value (key)
#Read each character from file
#If character is alphabet:
#Shift it by given key
#Else keep it same
#Write encrypted content into new file
#Close files
#Stop




shift = 3  # you can change shift value
